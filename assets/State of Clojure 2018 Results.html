                <p>Ten years ago, Chas Emerick ran the first State of Clojure survey. In 2010, most users had been using Clojure for just weeks or months, and few were using it as a language for serious work. <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-CDBF7CYT7/">This year</a>, we see consistent and growing use for <a href="#work">work</a>, steady interest in the key <a href="#values">value</a> propositions of Clojure, and an ever-evolving <a href="#community">community</a> of users.</p>

                <p>One of the questions we have been asking since 2010 is whether respondents are using Clojure for work, hobby projects, tinkering, or studies. This year, we saw the highest percentage yet of Clojure use at work:</p>

                <p>We also asked respondents for the first time how many people were using Clojure at their organization. As expected, many Clojure teams are small. As a high-leverage tool, Clojure is a great fit for small highly-productive teams. However, it was also great to see many respondents at companies with 40 or even 100+ Clojure developers.</p>

                <p>A question we’ve been asking since 2010 (with some variation in wording and choices), is in what domains Clojure is being used.

                <p>Since 2015, we have asked a question about which aspects of Clojure users valued the most. The weighted ranking of those answers has remained virtually identical since 2015. The most important things to Clojure users are: functional programming, the REPL, immutable data, ease of development, and host interop. Indeed these are all things intrinsic to the Clojure experience and align strongly with the reasons Clojure exists.</p>

                <p>For many years, the survey has included a question about "build tools", but this idea of a single monolithic tool has become increasingly less reflective of how people are managing Clojure projects, where they may use multiple tools for different parts of their process, particularly in mixed Clojure/ClojureScript projects. In response to this, we tailored this question more tightly to dependency management and made it multi-select this year:</p>

                <p>Looking at previous years, we continue to see strong (but slightly reduced) use of Leiningen, and a steady increase in use of clj/deps.edn. For ClojureScript work, shadow-cljs has made big strides over the last couple years, with big support from Clojurists Together.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>In the greater world of Java and the JVM, Java has migrated to a new release strategy where releases come out every spring and fall, and every 3 years there is a "long term support" (LTS) release - 8, 11, and (presumably) 17. Java 9 introduced a major change with the module system and in all JVM communities this has caused a significant user base to remain on Java 8. Clojure reflects this as well (although probably shows more shift to Java 11 than other language communities):</p>

                <p>Releases like Java 9, 10, 12, and soon 13 are effectively dead when the next release comes out and we would recommend sticking primarily to the LTS releases and maybe the latest release, if it’s not an LTS release.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>One aspect of Java 11 that is underappreciated is significant work to make Java work better in containers like Docker. If you are deploying in containerized environments with Java 8, you should really be looking closely at the changes in Java 11 and considering an upgrade.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Clojure itself has been using Java 8 as the baseline JVM for a couple years and will continue to do so (while also supporting newer versions of Java). When running Clojure, we recommend Java 8 or 11 right now.</p>

                <p>Since last year, we’ve seen strong uptake of Clojure 1.10.0 and 1.10.1. The latter was a maintenance release this year with error handling improvements building on the changes in Clojure 1.10.0 and mitigations for some Java performance regressions in their service releases after Java 8u201. Use of Clojure 1.8 and earlier continues to dwindle:</p>
