  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all visitors and users of the docland.com
    hosted services and websites (collectively, the “Website” or “Websites”).
    Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
    By accessing or using any part of the Websites or self-managed installations, you acknowledge you have been informed
    of and consent to our practices with regard to your personal information and data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Docland aims to be an open source project and collaborative community, as well as a company.
    This means that many portions of our Websites, including information you voluntarily provide,
    will be public-facing for the open sharing of innovative developments, ideas, and information that makes
    our collaborative community so great. While we are committed to open sharing,
    we strive to respect the privacy of individual community members and will minimize the information
    we collect and share. If you do not want to share your information,
    including personally identifiable information, with other community members and the public,
    please be thoughtful as to how you interact with our Websites and what information you provide through the Websites
    (for example, through creating a public profile, project contributions, comments, and blog posts).
  </p>
  <p>
    Docland takes the privacy and security of your information seriously.
    This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) will explain how we collect,
    use and share your personal information, and how you may exercise your rights.
    This Privacy Policy applies to the Docland websites (“Websites”), docland.app (“SaaS”), and Self-managed
    (“Self-managed”)
    products and services; collectively “Services.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Personal information” as used in this Privacy Policy is information that identifies or can reasonably be linked
    directly or indirectly to an identifiable person
  </p>

  <h2>What Information Docland collects and why</h2>
  <h3>Information from website visitors</h3>
  <p>
    Like most website operators, Docland collects basic non-personally-identifying information from Website visitors of
    the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
    referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We collect this information to better understand how
    visitors use the Website, to improve our Websites and experience for visitors, and to monitor the security of the
    Websites. From time to time, Docland may publicly release non-personally-identifying information collected from
    Website visitors in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Docland also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from
    visitors. Docland does not use such information to identify or track individual visitors, however. We collect this
    information to understand how visitors use the Websites, to improve performance and content, and to monitor the
    security of the Websites. For logged-in users to Docland deployments, Docland tracks potentially
    personally-identifiable user behavior on our application using our own software, to help us understand how to make
    the
    website more useful for different categories of user.
  </p>
  <p>
    Docland may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our Websites. For instance, Docland may reveal how
    many downloads a particular version got using aggregated statistics that contain anonymous user information only.
  </p>
  <h3>Personally-identifying information</h3>
  <p>
    Users of the Websites may choose to interact with Docland in ways that provide us with their personally-identifying
    information. In some instances, a User ID is generated for form and url tracking, page views, page pings and usage
    counts in order to ascertain product performance and development. The amount and type of information that Docland
    gathers depends on the nature of your interaction with us, as well as the amount of information you choose to share.
    For example, we ask visitors who use our community slack group to provide a username and email address. We will also
    collect the information you provide with us in connection with creating an account on the Website. Profile
    information
    is shared publicly, as well as activity under your profile. If you report a security vulnerability to Docland and
    request public acknowledgement, then we may publicly disclose the personal information you provided to us in
    connection with the report, including your name to fulfill your request for acknowledgement. In each case, Docland
    collects such personally-identifiable information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose
    of the user’s interaction with or request of Docland. We will not disclose personally-identifying information other
    than as described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Docland does not collect</h2>
  <p>
    Docland does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic
    data,
    health information, or religious information. Although Docland does not request or intentionally collect any
    sensitive
    personal information, we realize that users might store this kind of information in a Docland instance by pushing it
    to us through our libraries or API. If you store any sensitive personal information on Docland’s servers, you are
    consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, which are located in the United States.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on the Website. Docland does not knowingly
    collect
    information from or direct any of our Website or content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have
    reason
    to suspect that a user is under the age of 13, we will close the child’s account.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other countries may have different minimum age limits. If you are below the minimum age for providing consent for
    data
    collection in your country, you may not use Docland.
  </p>
  <p>
    Basis for processing your information
    Performance of a contract. The use of your information may be necessary to perform the contract that you have with
    us.
    For example, if you use our Websites to purchase Docland product subscriptions or services, contribute to a project,
    create a profile, post and comment through our Websites, or request information through our Websites, we will use
    your
    information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that contract or request.
  </p>
  <p>
    Legitimate interests. We use your information for our legitimate interests, such as to provide you with the best
    content through our Websites and communications with users and the public, to improve and promote our products and
    services, and for administrative, security, fraud prevention and legal purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consent. We may rely on your consent to use your personal information for certain direct marketing purposes, such as
    sending you newsletter updates about Docland products. You may withdraw your consent at any time through the
    unsubscribe feature provided with each marketing email or by contacting us at the addresses given at the end of this
    Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>How Docland uses and protects personally-identifying information</h2>
  <h3>Sharing your information</h3>
  <p>
    Docland only discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to those of its
    employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it
    on
    Docland's behalf or to provide services available on the Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to
    others.</p>

  <p>
    Please note, email and IP addresses of users of a Docland deployment may be shared with the respective users of that
    deployment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Docland will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
    Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Docland discloses
    potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or
    when
    Docland believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Docland,
    third parties, or the public at large.
  </p>
  <p>
    Docland takes measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or
    destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Docland at its sole discretion may make use of company logos where those companies are using the software that we
    provide. If you have concerns over the use of your logo, please email logos@Docland.com.
  </p>
  <h3>International transfer of information</h3>
  <p>
    The Website is hosted in the United States and information we collect will be stored and processed on our servers in
    the United States. Our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that process information for us as
    described above may be located in the United States or in other countries outside of your home country; by using the
    Website, you consent to the international transfer of your information by Docland.
  </p>

  <h3>Docland communications with you</h3>
  <p>If you are a registered user of the Websites and have supplied your email address, Docland may occasionally send
    you
    an email to tell you about security, system information, new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
    date with what's going on with Docland and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
    information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom
    of each of the marketing emails we send you so you can stop receiving such emails at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
    right
    to publish your request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. We
    will not publish your personally-identifiable information in connection with your request.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies, tracking technologies and Do Not Track</h2>
  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>
    A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser
    provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Docland uses cookies to help Docland identify and track
    visitors, their usage of the Websites, and their Website access preferences. Docland visitors who do not wish to
    have
    cookies placed on their computers may set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Websites. Disabling
    browser cookies may cause certain features of Docland's websites to not function properly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Certain pages on the Website may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos,
    from another site that sets a cookie. These sites set their own cookies and we do not have access or control over
    these cookies. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <h3>Tracking technologies</h3>
  <p>
    We may use third party tracking services, but we don’t use these services to track you individually or collect your
    personally identifiable-information. We may use these services to collect information about how the Website performs
    and how users navigate through and use the Website so we can monitor and improve our content and Website
    performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Third party tracking services gather certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your
    IP
    address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, timestamp, and similar data about your
    use
    of the Website. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user name.
  </p>
  <h3>Do Not Track</h3>
  <p>
    "Do Not Track" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and
    share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. Docland does not
    track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to
    track your activity on our site beyond our basic tracking, which you may opt out of. Because we do not share this
    kind
    of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection for any of our users, and we do
    not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual
    browser's Do Not Track setting.
  </p>

  <h2>Global privacy practices</h2>
  <p>
    Information we collect will be stored and processed in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy but
    we understand that users from other countries may have different expectations and rights with regard to their
    privacy.
    For all Website visitors and users, no matter their country of location, we will:
    provide clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent when we do collect your personal information;
    only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the purpose it is collected for, unless you choose to
    provide us more;
    offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting your information that we have collected, with the
    exception of information you voluntarily provide that is necessary to retain as is for the integrity of our project
    code as described further below; and
    provide Website users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing.
    We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are located in the European Union, you are entitled to the following rights with regard to your personal
    information and data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Right of access to your personal data, to know what information about you we hold</li>
    <li>Right to correct any incorrect or incomplete personal data about yourself that we hold</li>
    <li>Right to restrict/suspend our processing of your personal data</li>
    <li>Right to complain to a supervisory authority if you believe your privacy rights are being violated</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Additional rights that may apply to you in certain instances:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Right of data portability (if our processing is based on consent and automated means)</li>
    <li>Right to withdraw consent at any time (if processing is based on consent)</li>
    <li>Right to object to processing (if processing is based on legitimate interests)</li>
    <li>Right to object to processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes</li>
    <li>Right of erasure of your personal data from our system (“right to be forgotten”) if certain grounds are met</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To exercise your privacy rights, you can email us at the address given below in the ‘Contacting Docland About Your
    Privacy’ section of this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
  <p>
    If you already have an account on the Websites, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile
    information by logging into your account and updating profile settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Docland will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to perform our contractual
    obligations, provide you services through the Website, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve
    legal rights, or enforce our agreements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that due to the open source nature of our products, services, and community, we may retain limited
    personally-identifiable information indefinitely in order to ensure transactional integrity and nonrepudiation. For
    example, if you provide your information in connection with a blog post, GitHub issue or comment, we may display
    that
    information even if you have deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community posts. Also, if you
    contribute to a Docland project and provide your personal information in
    connection with that contribution, that information (including your name) will be embedded and publicly displayed
    with
    your contribution and we will not be able to delete or erase it because doing so would break the project code.
  </p>
  <h2>Contacting Docland about your privacy</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions or concerns about the way we are handling your information, or would like to exercise your
    privacy rights, please email us with the subject line "Privacy Concern" at privacy@docland.app.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will respond within 30 days of receiving your message at the latest but please note for promptest response, we
    recommend emailing us.
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy policy changes</h2>
  <p>
    Although most changes are likely to be minor, Docland may change its privacy policy from time to time, and in
    Docland's sole discretion.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may also provide notification to users who have provided us email addresses of material changes to this Privacy
    Policy through our Website. Docland encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any minor changes to its
    Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
    acceptance of such change.
