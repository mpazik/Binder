# Docland
Docland is an application that allows a user to display, organize, search and store all the articles and ebooks a person has ever read, together with personal annotations and comments.

### About the app
Docland's mission is to give you control over your data. Its design goal is to store all information documents together, forever.

The application is right now a distraction-free web reader as many others but has two distinctive features:
- PDFs and EPUBs support (in future other formats), so all articles, books, and annotations could be read, stores, and organized together
- data are stored in open formats on a personal cloud drive, so good privacy, no-vendor lock-in, no risk of data loss because of some company shutting down servers or mismanaging your data


We plan to extend the application with sharing capabilities and add the option to capture notes and structured information.
